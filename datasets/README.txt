The folder 'datatsets' includes all the network data used for the construction of lexicon expansion algorithms. Each file is present both as .json and .Rda because the .json might be easier to open and process, but the R scripts use the .Rda files. Networks are stored in the form of a edge list.

freedict.Rda is the colexification network on which the English LEXpander is based. It is constructed from FreeDict open source bilingual dictionaries as explained in (Di Natale et al., 2021). The network is already filtered for colexification patterns that occur in at least two languages. The columns are called 'from_word', 'to_word', 'FamilyWeight', 'LanguageWeight'. 'from_word' and 'to_word' are the two edges linked by a link in the network. The network is not directed and the nodes in 'from_word' and 'to_word' are sorted alphabetically (e.g. the word in 'from_word' comes always before the one in 'to_word'). 'LanguageWeight' is the weight of the link in number of languages that present the same colexification. 'FamilyWeight' is the weight of the link in number of families of langauges that present the same colexification occurrence.

freedict_deu.Rda is the German version of the same network. It was constructed with the same source and following the same procedure explained in (Di Natale et al., 2021). The network is filtered for colexification occurrences that happen in at least two languages. The columns are called 'from_word' and 'to_word'. 'from_word' and 'to_word' are the two edges linked by a link in the network and sorted alphabetically.

odenet_neigh.Rda is the network obtained from Odenet. It is built by considering linked to each other all the nodes belonging to a single synset. 'from_word' and 'to_word' are the two edges linked in the network and they are sorted alphabetically.
