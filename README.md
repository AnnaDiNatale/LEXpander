# LEXpander
Code and resources related to the paper "LEXpander: applying colexification networks to automated lexicon expansion" by Di Natale and Garcia. Now as ArXiv preprint: http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15850

The main script is script.Rmd. Scripts for supporting functions run in the main script are in the folder 'scripts'. 'Datasets' is the folder with all the networks used to build expansion algorithms. 'Results' is the folder with the files of the results of the experiments ran in the main script. 'Figures' collects the plots featured in the paper. Expanded word lists from the EVs are stored in the folder 'expanded_wordlists'. If you are looking for the annotated version, they are in the subfolder 'Annotated'.
